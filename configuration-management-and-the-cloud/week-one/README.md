## Introduction to Automation at Scale

### What is scale

Being able to **scale** means keep achieving larger impacts with the same amount of effort. A scalable system is a **flexible**.

**Automation** is an essential tool for keeping up with the infrastructure needs of a growing business.

### What is configuration management

**Unmanaged configuration** manually deploys the installation and configuring a computer.

**Managed configuration** uses a **configuration management system** to handle all of the configuration of the devices in the **nodes** which aims to solve the scaling problem.

* Typically you'll define a set of rules that have to be applied to the nodes you want to manage and then have a process that ensures that those settings are true on each of the nodes

Configuration management system allows a way to make changes to a system or group of systems in a **systematic**, **repeatable way**.
