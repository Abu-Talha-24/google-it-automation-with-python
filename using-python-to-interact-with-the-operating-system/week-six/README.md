# Using Python to Interact with the Operating System - Week 6

## Interacting with the Command Line Shell

### Basic Linux Commands
A lot of commands come from Unix. The philosophy when designing how these programs should behave was that they should do one thing and do it very well. Which means there will be a lot of commands, each for doing specific thing.

* echo - prints messages to the screen
* cat - shows contents of files
* ls - lists contents of a directory
    * ls -l - 
* chmod - changes permissions of a file
* mkdir - creates a new directory
* cd - changes into a directory
* pwd - prints the current working directory
* cp - copies files
* .. - reverses a parent directory
* . - reverses the current directory
* touch - creates an empty file
* mv - renames or moves a file
* rm - deletes files
    * \* - selects all

Command-line arguments let us change the behavior of commands making them do what we want.

* -l - prints extra information distributed in different columns
* -la - shows hidden files which are the ones that start with a dot
