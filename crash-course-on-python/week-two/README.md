# Crash Course of Python - Week 2

## Learning Objectives
* Write scripts that use variables of different data types
* Understand how flow control works in Python
* Implement branches with conditional expressions
* Encapsulate code into functions

---

## Expression and Variables
### Data Types
There are different data tpyes in Python. Some of the examples include:
* String which represents text wrapped in quotation marks to be manipulated by a script
* Integer which represents whole numbers without a fraction (ex. 1)
* Float which represents real numbers like a number with a fractional part (ex. 2.5)

Generally, computer doesn't know how to mix different data types - it results "TypeError".

If you're ever not 100 percent sure what data types a certain value is, Python gives you a handy way to find out. You can use the type function, to have the computer tell you the type

### Variables
* **Variables** are names that we give to certain values in our programs - variables are like containers for data.
    * Values can be of any data type; numbers, strings or even the results of operations.
    * Variables are important in programming because they let you perform operations on data that may change
* **Assignment** is the process of storing a value inside a variable.
    * A value is assigned to a variable by using the equal sign in the form of variable equals value
* An **expression** is a combination of numbers, symbols or other variables that produce a result when evaluated.

Below are some restrictions when naming variables in Python
1. Key words or functions that Python reserves for its own cannot be used as variable names
2. Variable names can't have any spaces and they must start with either a letter or an underscore
3. Variable names can only be made up of letters, numbers and underscores
4. Python variables are case sensitive

### Expressions, Numbers, and Type Conversion
**Implicit conversion** takes plance when the interpreter automatically converts one data type into another.
**Explicit conversion** takes place when a function is called to convert one data type into antother
