Modify the double_word function so that it returns the same word repeated twice, followed by the length of the new doubled word. For example, double_word("hello") should return hellohello10.

Modify the first_and_last function so that it returns True if the first letter of the string is the same as the last letter of the string, False if theyâ€™re different. Remember that you can access characters using message[0] or message[-1]. Be careful how you handle the empty string, which should return True since nothing is equal to nothing.
