## String
### What is a string?
A **string** is a data type in Python that's used to represent a piece of text.

Strings can be concatenated to build longer strings by using the plus sign or multiplied by a number, which multiplies the content of the string that many times.

## The Parts of a String
The **string indexing** operation accesses the character in a given position or index using square brackets and the number of the position specified
* string[0]
* To access the last character of a string, use negative indexes
* A **slice** is the portion of a string that can contain more than one character (ex. string[1:4])
