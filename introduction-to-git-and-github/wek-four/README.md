# Introduction to Git and GitHub - Week 4

## Collaboration

### Pull Requests

**Forking** is a way of creating a copy of the given repository so that it belongs to our user.

**Pull request** is a commit or series of commits that you send to the owner of the repository so that they incorporate it into their tree.

When collaborating on projects hosted on GitHub, the typical workflows is:

1. Create a fork of the repo
2. Work on that local fork

## Code Review

**Code review** means going through someone else's code, documentation or configuration and checking that it all makes sense and follows the expected patterns.

The goal of a code review is:

* To improve the project by making sure that changes are high quality
* Helps make the contents are easy to understand
* The style is consistent with the overall project
* Remind us about any important cases
